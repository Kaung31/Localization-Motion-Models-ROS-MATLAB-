# MATLAB Robotics Coursework â€“ Localization & Motion Models  

This project contains MATLAB implementations of robotics algorithms developed as part of my coursework.  
It focuses on **robot localization, motion models, ROS callbacks, and working with sensor datasets**.  
Each task builds on different aspects of robotic perception and control.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview  

- **Task 1** â€“ ROS subscriber callbacks (markers, poses, ranges) and basic robot control.  
- **Task 2** â€“ Velocity motion model simulation in MATLAB.  
- **Task 3** â€“ Dataset-based localization using ground truth and noisy sensor data.  
- **Task 4** â€“ Extended experiment in robot localization/control.  
- **Task 5** â€“ Refinement of the velocity motion model.
